The sculptures were often painted with a variety of colors, but the primary color used for the surface finish was a type of limestone or marble dust mixed with water to create a whitewash, which was applied to the statue. This was the standard practice from around 500 BCE to 500 CE.",

Archaeological evidence and historical records indicate that the statues were typically rendered in a range of colors, including red, yellow, blue, green, and black, using various materials such as paint, gilding, and stucco. The colors were used to depict the subject's skin tones, clothing, and accessories. Over time, the pigments have faded, and the statues are now often perceived as white or beige due to the erosion of the original colors.",
